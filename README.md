# Realtime Chat with Meteor + Blaze!

## How to Run
Clone this repo. If you don't already have Meteor, see https://docs.meteor.com/about/install.html or just run:

```
npx meteor
```

Then in your project directory, run:

```
meteor npm install
meteor
```

Open up http://localhost:3000/ and see the result. Trying opening in two different windows!
